    Pony fans out there can replace their JetBrains PHPStorm Progress Bar by the only thing that matters: A nice Pony.
    Ponies are working hard for their life so they will be a good support for every developer.<br />
    <br />
    This plugin is entirely based on the <a href="https://github.com/dlsniper/gopher">Gopher plugin</a> by
    Florin Pățan, and inherits <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8575-nyan-progress-bar">Nyan Progress Bar plugin</a>
    from Dmitry Batkovich.<br />
    <br />
    Props are also to Roman Pronskiy for releasing the <a href="https://github.com/pronskiy/elephpant-progress-bar">Elephpant progress bar</a> which started the discussion
    that has led to this pony progress bar plugin.
