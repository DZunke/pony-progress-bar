Pony Progress Bar Plugin
---

Pony fans out there can replace their JetBrains PHPStorm Progress Bar by the only thing that matters: A nice Pony. 
Ponies are working hard for their life so they will be a good support for every developer.

This plugin is entirely based on the <a href="https://github.com/dlsniper/gopher">Gopher plugin</a> by
Florin Pățan, and inherits <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8575-nyan-progress-bar">Nyan Progress Bar plugin</a> from Dmitry Batkovich.

Props are also to Roman Pronskiy for releasing the <a href="https://github.com/pronskiy/elephpant-progress-bar">Elephpant progress bar</a> which started the discussion 
that has led to this pony progress bar plugin.
